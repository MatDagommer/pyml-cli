## Version 0.1.3

This release introduces a major project rename, improvements to the release workflow, and several fixes to the CI/CD pipeline. The project is now called **pyml-cli** (formerly ml-cli), and trusted publishing to PyPI is enabled. Several workflow and dependency management enhancements are included.

### New Features

- Rename the project from "ml-cli" to "pyml-cli" across the entire codebase, documentation, CLI entry point, and configuration files. All references, scripts, and documentation now use the new name. (1e847e) (MatDagommer)

### Bug Fixes

- Allow the PyPI publish step in the CI workflow to not fail the entire workflow if publishing fails, improving release robustness. (454e12) (MatDagommer)
- Fix version number extraction in the release workflow by removing an unnecessary grep command, simplifying the pipeline. (5abc2a) (MatDagommer)
- Add the missing 'bump' subcommand to the bump-my-version invocation in the release workflow, ensuring version bumps work as intended. (ed440b) (MatDagommer)
